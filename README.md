# Wait for Netlify Deployment

Do you have other Github actions (Lighthouse, Cypress, etc) that depend on the Netlify deploy URL? This action will wait until the deploy URL is available before running the next task.

This action uses the Netlify API to always retrieve the correct deployment being built. You will need to generate a [Personal Access Token](https://app.netlify.com/user/applications/personal) to use and pass it as the `NETLIFY_TOKEN` environment variable.

## Env

### `NETLIFY_TOKEN`

**Required.** Your Netlify [Personal Access Token](https://app.netlify.com/user/applications/personal) to use for API access. This should be set as a GitHub secret, see example.

## Inputs

### `site_id`

**Required** The API ID of your site. See Settings > Site Details > General in the Netlify UI

### `max_timeout`

Optional — The amount of time to spend waiting on the Netlify deployment to respond with a success HTTP code after reaching "ready" status. Defaults to 60 seconds.

### `context`

Optional — The Netlify deploy context. Can be `branch-deploy`, `production` or `deploy-preview`. Defaults to all of them.

### `request_headers`

Optional - Additional headers to send with the request. Will be used when to check deployed URL. Defaults to `{}`.

## Outputs

### `url`

The Netlify deploy preview url that was deployed.

### `deploy_id`

The Netlify deployment ID that was deployed.

## Example usage

Basic Usage

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Wait for Netlify Deploy
    uses: probablyup/wait-for-netlify-action@3.2.0
    id: waitForDeployment
    with:
      site_id: 'YOUR_SITE_ID' # See Settings > Site Details > General in the Netlify UI
    env:
      NETLIFY_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NETLIFY_TOKEN }}

# Then use it in a later step like:
# ${{ steps.waitForDeployment.outputs.url }}
```
